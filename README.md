# TSwap Smart Contract Audit

## Overview

TSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) forked from Uniswap with custom modifications. This repository contains the security audit of TSwap, analyzing its smart contracts for vulnerabilities, optimizations, and adherence to best security practices.

## Scope of Audit

The audit covers the following aspects:

- **Security vulnerabilities**: Identifying potential exploits, reentrancy attacks, access control issues, etc.
- **Gas optimizations**: Enhancing contract efficiency and reducing gas costs.
- **Logic verification**: Ensuring the intended functionality aligns with the implementation.
- **Compliance checks**: Verifying adherence to Solidity best practices and security standards.

## Audit Methodology

1. **Code Review**: Manual and automated review of the smart contract code.
2. **Static Analysis**: Using tools to detect vulnerabilities and inefficiencies.
3. **Dynamic Testing**: Simulating real-world interactions to identify unexpected behaviors.
4. **Formal Verification (if applicable)**: Analyzing contract logic to ensure correctness.

## Findings Summary

| Issue Severity | Count |
| -------------- | ----- |
| Critical       | X     |
| High           | X     |
| Medium         | X     |
| Low            | X     |
| Informational  | X     |

Detailed findings are documented in the **Audit Report**.

## Recommendations

Based on the identified issues, we provide mitigation strategies and improvements to enhance security and efficiency.

## Tools Used

- Slither
- Mythril
- Foundry (for fuzz testing)
- Hardhat/Echidna
- Manual review

## Disclaimer

This audit does not guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities. It is the responsibility of the TSwap team to implement fixes and conduct additional testing before deployment.
